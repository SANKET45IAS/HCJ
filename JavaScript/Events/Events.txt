Yes, in JavaScript, an Event is an object. It represents an occurrence or action that is triggered during the interaction with the web page, such as a mouse click, keypress, or form submission.

When an event occurs, an Event object is created, containing various properties and methods that provide details about the event, such as:

Event Type: The type of event (e.g., 'click', 'keydown', etc.).
Target: The element on which the event occurred.
Default Action: The default behavior of the event, which can be prevented or modified.
Coordinates: The position of the mouse (e.g., clientX, clientY for mouse events).
Key: For keyboard events, the key that was pressed.


üéØ Explanation of Events:
Mouse Events:

click: Fired when the user clicks the button (Click Me).
mouseover: Fired when the mouse enters the hoverArea.
mouseout: Fired when the mouse leaves the hoverArea.
Keyboard Events:

keydown: Fired when the user presses a key while focused on the input.
keyup: Fired when the user releases the key after pressing it.
Form Events:

submit: Fired when the form is submitted (prevents default submission and logs the event).
Focus and Blur Events:

focus: Fired when the input receives focus (clicked or tabbed into).
