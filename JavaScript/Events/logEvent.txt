The logEvent function is a simple helper function that is used to log the details of each event when it is triggered.
It appends a new log message to the #log div, so that you can see a record of what event occurred and when it happened.

Purpose:
The logEvent function is called whenever an event occurs (like clicking a button or pressing a key), 
and it helps you visually track what event has happened. You can see each event message being added to the log at the bottom of the page.

For example, if you click the button with the text "Click Me", the event handler triggers logEvent("Button clicked! (click)"), 
and it displays that message in the log section.
